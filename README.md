<h1>Runbook Activity 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this activity, I created a sample of a Runbook for a fake company that would be used in a new hire onboarding process. The steps outlined in this runbook should be followed to set up a new hire PC to ensure the PC is flawlessly connected to the network and they are all set to perform job tasks/functions once their PC is issued. Completing and documenting this activity helped me refresh my understanding of runbooks, active directory, and Windows OS.
